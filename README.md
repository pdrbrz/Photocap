# Photocap
Captures your best side - every time.


Hello folks,

As requested, here is the example app for the assessment.
I focused on the user experience, trying to make the app easy to use.
There is also some example work on unit testing and localization that I would like to improve, but I avoided taking too long and aimed to stick to around one hour as required. It did take longer than an hour, so I tried to balance time spent and quality here. :)
I locked the orientation to Portrait to avoid weird interactions with the view repositioning.
The extra zoomable funcionality was added to the Photo/Frame previews.
In my current work 95% of the job is done with UIKit, so I also took this as a challenge to develop with SwiftUI. 
Looking forward to your feedback. 

Thanks, team!
